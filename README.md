# Chatbot-Based Empathy Induction Study
This repository contains code for a study exploring how disembodied virtual agents (chatbots) can evoke empathy through self-imagine and other-imagine perspective-taking exercises. The study examines the effectiveness of interactive chatbot mediums compared to non-interactive text-based mediums in eliciting empathy during sensitive scenarios.

## Research Background
Empathy is a crucial social skill, and this study investigates how chatbots can promote empathy without the embodied cues of traditional virtual agents (e.g., avatars or social robots). Using chatbots for empathy induction offers several advantages, including accessibility, scalability, and the ability to engage users at any time. This project aims to determine whether chatbot-mediated interactions can foster emotional reflection and empathy more effectively than static, non-interactive methods like reading text-based transcripts.

### Research Questions
- RQ1: To what extent does self-imagine perspective-taking evoke stronger state empathy than other-imagine perspective-taking in sensitive scenarios?
- RQ2: How does the interactive quality of the medium (interactive chatbot medium vs. non-interactive text-based medium) influence the elicitation of state empathy in sensitive scenarios?
- RQ3: Is there an interaction effect between the medium (interactive chatbot medium vs. non-interactive text-based medium) and perspective-taking (self-imagine vs. other-imagine) on state empathy in sensitive scenarios?
- RQ4: In what ways do chatbot interactions differ qualitatively between the self-imagine and other-imagine perspective-taking conditions?

## Methodology
The study utilizes a 2x2 between-subjects design:

Perspective-Taking: Self-imagine vs. Other-imagine
Medium: Interactive Chatbot vs. Non-Interactive Text-Based Medium
The research compares the effectiveness of these methods in evoking empathy during interactions about sensitive scenarios.

## Key Features of the Code
Chatbot Interaction: Facilitates self-imagine and other-imagine perspective-taking exercises to explore empathy responses.

Data Collection: Collects data on emotional engagement and empathy levels from users interacting with chatbots or reading text-based transcripts.

Text Analysis with VADER: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is used for sentiment analysis of both chatbot and user responses. VADER provides a simple, lexicon-based tool for analyzing text in terms of its sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), which is essential for measuring emotional engagement and empathy levels throughout the interactions.

Analysis Framework: Designed to support the comparison of empathy levels between the different conditions (medium and perspective-taking) based on the sentiment scores obtained from VADER.

Visualisation: Includes graphs and data visualizations for analyzing the results of the experiment.
